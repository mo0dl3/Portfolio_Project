                            Hi and welcome to my page. I'm Theodor Ewida. I am a new programer currently learning through Codecademy and recent graduate from the University of Sydney with a Bachelor of Science majoring in Neuroscience. I am also a self taught mechanic and watchmaker.

                        <p>
                            There are a couple of the projects I have completed during my short time programing.
                            <details><ul>
                                <summary><li>Javascript</li></summary>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Simple temperature unit conversion console application</li>
                                    <li>Credit card checking program that compares card numbers against a rule set to determine their validity</li>
                                    <li>A program that assess the likelyhood that a mutation of a known organism comprising of 15 DNA bases will survive. The program generates multiple mutations of the organism and assess its chance to survive by identifing if the organism has a certain percentage of a paticular base.</li>
                                    <li>Created the functions for a number guessing game. The game generates a secret number then the user and the computer both make a guess. The program then awards a point to the player closest to the secret number.</li>
                                    <li>Simple console app that converts human age to dog years.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <summary><li>C#</li></summary>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Snake-like console game where the user controls an arrow. The user scores by collecting an @.</li>
                                    <li>A program that generates a random ASCII creature in the console using a set of monster body parts and randomly arranging them</li>
                                    <li>Create a text based choose your own adventure console program.

                                    <li>Simple encryption and decryption console program. It asks the user whether they want to encrypt or decrypt a string. The encryption process advances each letter in the input by 4 letter and does the reverse for the decryption process.</li>
                                    <li>Mad libs console program that asks the user for a variety of inputs and combines them into a story.</li>
                                    <li>Change calculator that converts a user defined amount into 3 coin of varying values.</li>

THe program checks for how many of the conditions the user's password has met then reports back with a strength rating.</li>
                                    <li>Program that searches through a .tvs database using LINQ. The program returns the results of the search reformatted in readable format.</li>
                                    <li>True or false console quiz. The quiz only takes true or false as an input regardless of capitalisation. When the program recieves an input that is not either true or false it returns an error and asks the user to input either true or false.</li>
                                </details></ul>
